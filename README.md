## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit:** Php 200,000.00
- **Final Total:** Php 200,510.00
- **✅ Within Budget / ❌ Over Budget:** Over Budget (Within 5% over 200,000)
- Notes on trade-offs:
1. **CPU (Intel Core Ultra 9 285K):** More expensive than most processors in the market but enhances performance especially for multitasking and heavy workloads. Above and beyond the specifications of an entry-level gaming build.
2. **Motherboard (MSI MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi):** To get the best performance, some tweaks to BIOS may be needed which can lead to a risk of misconfiguration. Furthermore, it requires more thermal output and power due to the high VRAM.
3. **RAM (G.Skill Ripjaws M5 64GB (2x32GB) DDR5 6000):** 32GB would have been sufficient for an entry-level gaming PC however, having 64GB provides better future-proofing and can handle demanding workloads.
4. **Storage (3x Samsung 9100 Pro 1TB PCIe 5.0 NVMe SSDs):** Lacking an HDD which would have decreased the cost of the build while providing the same storage space. The trade off to 3x - 1TB SSDs provide the build with better speed.
5. **GPU (MSI RTX 5070 TI 16GB):** Offers less FPS than the RTX 5080 especially at 4k or high refresh 1440p. Has less headroom to increase graphics settings and more future-proofing for newer games. The 5070ti also draws less power compared to the 5080 but still needs a higher PSU wattage than most entry-level builds.
6. **PSU (Seasonic Vertex PX-1000 Platinum 1000W):** Due to being a premium PSU that outputs high efficiency, it can be expensive. It can also be noisy when under heavy load. 
7. **CPU Cooler (Corsair iCue Link Titan 360 RX LCD AIO):** LCD screen makes the build more expensive while providing no performance boost (LCD is purely for aesthetic purposes). Similar performing non-LCD coolers are less expensive. 
8. **Case & Fans (NZXT H5 Flow RGB + NZXT F120 4pcs):** Has excellent airflow and thermals at an added cost. Perfect for high-performance builds but expensive for an entry-build gaming PC.
