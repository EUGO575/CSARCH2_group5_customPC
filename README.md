## 1. Introduction
The project is designing a custom desktop PC buld targeted for extreme-entry level gaming. Despite the primary purpose being gaming, the build will also be able to support heavy workloads such as video editing. The budget set for this build is ₱200,000.00 which may exceed 5% more (₱210,000.00) but not less than the budget. Given the high budget, the build will feature high-end components within this price tier while considering the cost to performance ratio of the parts. The build will also ensure all parts are modern/recently release and compatible for the workload it will take. The build is made for great gaming performance and more. 

The system design will feature an Intel-based Processor with the possibility of a dedicated graphics cards to ensure a smooth gaming experience. Each component will be chosen and double checked for compatibility to properly utilize each part. The components will be chosen from both PCPartPicker and local stores based in Metro Manila. The components from local stores may be selected from a single store to keep consistecy and ease of purchase though the final selection may include parts from other local suppliers if necessary.

## 4. Compatibility Justification
For each part, explain compatibility and choices.  
Example:  
- **CPU + Motherboard**: Intel i5-13400F (LGA1700) works with ASUS B760M board (LGA1700 socket, BIOS compatible).  
- **RAM**: DDR5 RAM supported by motherboard slots (up to 128GB).  
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3060 fits case, PSU wattage sufficient.

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱200,000.00 (or %5 over budget = ₱210000)
- **Final Total**: ₱200,510.00
- ✅ Within budget
- Notes on trade-offs (e.g., cheaper RAM, higher PSU wattage, no aftermarket cooler, etc.).
1. **CPU (Intel Core Ultra 9 285K):** More expensive than most processors in the market but enhances performance especially for multitasking and heavy workloads. Above and beyond the specifications of an entry-level gaming build.
2. **Motherboard (MSI MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi):** To get the best performance, some tweaks to BIOS may be needed which can lead to a risk of misconfiguration. Furthermore, it requires more thermal output and power due to the high VRAM.
3. **RAM (G.Skill Ripjaws M5 64GB (2x32GB) DDR5 6000):** 32GB would have been sufficient for an entry-level gaming PC however, having 64GB provides better future-proofing and can handle demanding workloads.
4. **Storage (3x Samsung 9100 Pro 1TB PCIe 5.0 NVMe SSDs):** Lacking an HDD which would have decreased the cost of the build while providing the same storage space. The trade off to 3x - 1TB SSDs provide the build with better speed.
5. **GPU (MSI RTX 5070 TI 16GB):** Offers less FPS than the RTX 5080 especially at 4k or high refresh 1440p. Has less headroom to increase graphics settings and more future-proofing for newer games. The 5070ti also draws less power compared to the 5080 but still needs a higher PSU wattage than most entry-level builds.
6. **PSU (Seasonic Vertex PX-1000 Platinum 1000W):** Due to being a premium PSU that outputs high efficiency, it can be expensive. It can also be noisy when under heavy load. 
7. **CPU Cooler (Corsair iCue Link Titan 360 RX LCD AIO):** LCD screen makes the build more expensive while providing no performance boost (LCD is purely for aesthetic purposes). Similar performing non-LCD coolers are less expensive. 
8. **Case & Fans (NZXT H5 Flow RGB + NZXT F120 4pcs):** Has excellent airflow and thermals at an added cost. Perfect for high-performance builds but expensive for an entry-build gaming PC.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
- This case study used PCPartPicker for the international prices and DynaquestPC (Manila Based) for the local supplier. A conversion rate of Php 57.92 per 1 USD was used to compare international and local prices. We concluded that there is a significant price difference between the computer parts sold internationally and locally. The total cost of the parts from PCPartPicker came out to $2884.90 or Php 167,093.40 while DynaquestPC came out to Php 200,510. The Php 33,416.60 difference between the two can be attributed to the shipping fees, import fees, and other related expenses that local stores must shoulder. Since most computer parts are manufactured/originated from the US or other foreign nations, there are less logistics involved when they distribute/sell the products in their own country. 

- Finding stock in local stores proved to be more difficult than internationally sourced ones as some parts are not sold in the Philippines. It may be due to demand/logistic issues as well as shortages that can happen all around the world. While our build did not have trouble with pricing, we found that compatibility with the parts are still tricky and can have trade offs. We have learned to not skimp out on the parts as choosing a cheaper option may lead to worse or catastrophic performance. An example would be a low-end PSU that is cheaper but has to run with high-end GPU which can lead to power instability.

- Since our budget for the build is high, we were also able to learn about future-proofing our PC by choosing components like PCIe Gen 5 and DDR5 Ram as well as plenty of expansion slots so that it can keep up with new softwares and games that might require more resources in the future. We also learned about the importance of cooling and power especially with the more demanding components. Investing in a stable power supply and top-tier cooling ensures that the system can handle heavy workloads and maintain stability. Lack of proper cooling and power can cause the PC to deteriorate over time and cause performance throttling. Through this case study, the group has learned that a balanced build is essential for system design. We saw how compatibility played a major role in system design. Choosing a high-end component like a top-tier GPU and pairing it off with a low-end/average component like an underpowered PSU will most likely cause the build problems since the PSU wouldn’t be able to supply the GPU enough power and it can create bottlenecks that reduce the overall performance of the PC. The synergy between the components is important for every PC build to maximize its potential in terms of both performance and cost. Whether the build is a low-end, average, or high-end build, balancing all the parts is important to ensure that no component is being underutilised or overworked.
